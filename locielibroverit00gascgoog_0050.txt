One event, however, occurred in the autumn of 1457, which made
a deep impression on Gascoigne's mind, the trial and condemnation oi
Pecok. The singular circumstances which attended this trial, the lact
- that this bishop is the only prelate os the pre-reformation period who
was sormally condemned sor heresy, the ambiguous and obscure character
os the charges made against him, and the happy accident that one os the
books at least sor which he was condemned has been preserved in the
CambridgeUniversity Library (having been printed in the Rolls' Series
by Mr. Churchill Babington)‚ and is, apart from any intrinsic merits
which it may possess, a most interesting work, written in fifteenth-century
English by an educated churchman, have surrounded the memory of
Pecok with a reputation which his critics and judges would have hardly
anticipated. In his search aiter witnesses, Fox makes him a devout

’ precursor oi the Reformation, a pious prelate who was grievously sinned

against. Lewis‚ who has written his lile, but certainly has never read
Gascoigne’s MS, speaks os ‘his lordship' with similar feelings ol re·
verence. Gascoigne tells us more about him than any one else, ior
he detested him heartily, and rejoices over his condemnation with the
most orthodox satisfaction.

Reginald Pecok was by birth aWelshman‚ a iellow ol Oriel College,
Oxford, who at first (p. 18) had a considerable reputation sor learning
and orthodoxy, who quitted Oxford for the court, and graduatcd in
theology by special licence‚ or dispensation ol the regents in the Oxford
Schools (ie. the younger masters), in the year 1445, when Gascoigne
was Chancellor (pp. 26, 215). He had been made Bishop ol St. Asaph
in 1444, by the influence oi two well-known persons, and sorthwith took
an active part in public affairs, writing and publishing both English and
Latin books, the names of two os which, ‘De Fide’ and the ‘Provoker,'
have been preserved by Gascoigne. In 1447 and 1449 he preached at
Paul’s Cross, to the effect that bishops were not bound to preach by
virtue oi their office3 that originally the sunction os bishop and parish
priest were one, but that since the parochial clergy had been entrusted
with local dutieS, they had relieved the bishops from their previous
obligations. It appears that he published this sermon in English, and
that it made him highly popular with his episcopal brethren. He

further held that it was the bishop’s duty to be better informed about
