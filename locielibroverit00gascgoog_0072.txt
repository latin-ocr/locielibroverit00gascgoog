A curious illustration of the view which might be taken as to his powers
is given in the account of the threat ol Martin the Fifth (p. 17) to
Chichele and the other English prelates about the year ¹430· The

Pope was anxious to get the statute against Papal provisions repealed,
threatened the English bishops with excommunication for not doing
what they were unable to effect, or did not dare to attempt, and actually
suspended Chichele lrorn his official legateship. ‘Then the bishops
openly said that a General Council was superior to the Pope, and there·
upon appealed from the Pope to the General Council which was about to
be held (of Basle), though very osten before they had held different
language, saying that the Pope was superior to a General Council, and

The authority of the Papacy was very osten found to be a conve·

were illegal, they were exceedingly frequent. The King often applied
for them, though the grant was a breach os the law. By the Great
Charter, capitular elections were to be sree. But kings wished to provide

to royal recommendations, while they could be constrained to submission
by the threat of excornmunication-a threat which was not suffered to
lie idle-which, while in operation, deprived the people ol religious
offices, and the priest ol his sees—a very notable part of his income
in the middle ages. Besides, there were many ways in which the Roman
Court could revenge itself on those who defied its pretensions or its claims.
Its prohibited degrces, for example, made a dispensation sor marriage
constantly necessary, sor though its rule was strict, it allowed, for a
