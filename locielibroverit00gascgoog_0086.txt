new monasteries. There were plenty of them in existence. Land was
very valuable, and the law very jealous os monasteries acquiring land.
There was however, one way in which an active and ambitious man could
better his sortunes‚ or an ailing sinner could secure his forgiveness. This
was by robbing the parochial clergy. The lessee for a very long term on
a very beneficia] holding os abbey lands, could make a good bargain with
the abbey3 and a srightened offender could satisfy himself that he would
get the perpetual prayers of the monks, the value ol which was not as
yet disputed, if either of them could assist the monks in turning rectories
into vicarages-that is, in securing the principal tithes to the monastery,
and arranging that the monks should provide the services of some vicar
who would undertake the cure os souls and the offices of the church lor
a very much smaller stipend than the income ol the rectory. The vicar

the war with France was no longer a profitable calling.

The appropriation of benefices to monasterieS, colleges‚ capitular
dignities and collegiate churches began very early. The reasoning which
led to the practice was very natural. The monks ol the older orders
were industrious and learned. They reclaimed wastes, improved agricul-
ture, and wrote books. Had it not been for the monasterieS‚ every trace

been sor the monasteries, it is difficult to conceive how civilisation could
have revived alter the aristocracy and caesarism of Rome had ruined
ancient culture3 sor the barbarians, in destroying the remains of it, inri-
tated and perpetuated the hatesul institutions which had wasted the
whole world. We should not even have known the history ol our own
people if it had not been ior the monks, sor the chronicles of the abbeys
are the principal materials sor the annals os England. In the days oi
violence the abbeys were nearly the only refuge3 in the days ol igno·
rance they were the only schools Many a thriving English town owes
its existence to the fostering care ol the monks. The two English
Universities seem to have grown up obscurely under the shadow of
ancient monasteries. It was obvious that these establishments should
be endowed with the most permanent source os revenue, a tax on agri·'
