thau a century the equipoise os the constitution, and gave the opportunity
for a despotism, which in the hands ol Henry the Eighth so impoverished
England as to make it, till the time oi Cromwell‚ a third-rate power in
Europe. The beginnings ol the civil strise were witnessed, its causes
discovered, and its effects in some measure predicted by Gascoigne.
And though in his estimate ol these causes, my author dwells almost
too exclusively on ecclesiastical abuses, it will not be difficult sor us to
see that those abuses were at once an effect and a cause, and that the
greediness‚ selfishness, neglect oi duty, and political perfidy which cha·
racterised the churchmen ol the fisteenth century were possible in the
clergy by reason that they were even more rise and more scandalous in
the laity.

The war which Henry commenced was carried on vigorously by
John, Duke of Bedlord, who was two years younger than the king.
There was only a year’s interval between each of the three younger sons,
Thomas, Duke oi Clarence, having been born in 1388, and Humphrey oi
Gloucester‚ the youngest of the four, in 1389. Thomas had been killed
at Beauge in 1421. The administration of home affairs was generally in
the hands ol the younger brother, whose impetuous temper and rash
acts embroiled him with his uncle, the Bishop of Winchester. These
differences began as early as 1424, and lasted with little intermission till

the Protector's suspicious death in 1446. Gascoigne tells us that it was ,

owing (p. 155) to the intrigues and deceits ol Beaufort that Otho
Colonna (Martin V) was elected to the Papacy in 1417, instead oi a better
man, at the Council oi Constance‚ by certain cardinals and certain

, deputies oi the Council. The election ol Martin V was the cause of

grave scandals in the Roman Court (p.154), and might have caused
serious complications between England and the Papacy (p. 17) had
, not the Pope’s death occurred.

But a curse seemed to hang over the House ol Lancaster. The three
sons ol Henry the Fourth married and were childless, two ol them, the
Dukes ol Bedsord and Gloucester‚ having married twice. In 1446 it
seemed that the family would become naturally extinct, unless issue
might be expected from the King and Queen who had been married in the
summer of 1445. But no child was born os this marriage for more than
eight years, when the Queen gave birth on October 23, 1453, to Edward ol
