whose resignation was neither so complete nor so pious as that os Gas-
coigne. Suffolk, they concluded‚ had brought another Helen to new Troy.

Gascoigne tells a curious story about the marriage of Margaret
(pp. 190, 205, 219). He says that aiter Suffolk had negotiated the
marriage, he lost sight ol Margaret, and remained seventeen weeks in
France, without knowing where she was3 that subsequently he returned
to England and procured a grant srom Parliament, and on returning to
France, iound that Margaret was detained by the French King, who, on
the ground that she was Queen oi England, and had no ‘saie conduct’

Ι out of F rauce, declared that she should not be given up without ransom,

and that he, searing the consequences, induced the King to resign Maine
and Anjou under the Great Seal, in order to get possession of the King’s
affianced wile. This cession, says Gascoigne, not only cost England
Normandy and Guienne, but put the French into such a position that
they could refuse the payment of an annual tribute sor the cession of the
provinces, and were even able to evade a final peace between the two
kingdoms.

There are iew portions os the parliamentary history of England

the King oi France thicker than the loins ol the King oi England, and
were irritated at the taxes which their new master heaped on them.
He had perhaps imposed, in imitation os the export duties on wool,

pay these taxes but that the impost damaged Gascon trade. At any
rate, they sent envoys to the English Court, promising to revolt is they
were assisted by a competent force. Their offers were accepted, and the
old Earl of Shrewsbury‚ who had risen to an earldom by his conduct in
the war oi the F rench succession, was made Lieutenant of Guienne on
September 3. There seemed to be a chance that the events os 1450
would be reversed, and on March 6, 1453, a Parliament was summoned,
in which Thomas Thorpe, one of the officials os the Exchequer, and six
years afterwards one oi its barons, was elected Speaker. The House,
in the absence of the Chancellor (Kemp), was addressed by the Bishop
oi Lincoln‚ who declared that the cause of the summons was the sound
