as great in England during the fifteenth, as they were in Germany in the
sixteenth century, and had the timebeen ripe for it, Peter de Monte's sale
of indulgences in 1440 was as provocative of secession (pp. 123-5) as that
of Tetzel nearly eighty years afterwards. But the grievance felt at the
acts of'the Papal Court is even worse, because uninterrupted. From
John the Twenty-second (James D’Euse), one of the Avignon popes,
down to the latest years of Gascoigne's life, the Cardinals and other
officials of the Court are little better than a gang of brigands, who
pillaged Europe and especially England‚-who taxed the clergy with
first-fruits, claimed and occupied English beneficeS, extorted huge sums
of money from England‚ sold bulls, presentations and provisions, poisoned
popes who checked their ill doings, and murdered on false charges of
heresy honest preachers and genuine reformers The dawn of Luther’s
reformation was before Gascoigne's mind, and though he would have
abhorred schism sincerely‚ he would have thankfully welcomed an escape
from the mercenary crew which constituted the Roman Court. lf my
reader will take an example, let him read the story (p. 154) of Prosper
Colonna‚ of Louis of Luxembourg (p. 136), of Calixtus the Third (pp.
12-13), and of the unordained fool who, by licence of Eugenius the
Fourth, held a number of beneficeS, whose story (e. g. p. 195) is frequently
repeated.

‘The divInes of the fifteenth century seem to have generally held
that, in one particular at least, a General Council was superior to the
Pope. It could depose him. It did so by Benedict the Thirteenth‚
Gregory the Twelfth, and John the Twenty·third (Baithasar Cossa), and
the decrees of these Councils were accepted. The Council of Constance
even took part in the election of Martin the F ifth. ln dealing then with
the discipline of the Church, as represented by the highest official,
a General Council could set aside an existing pontifi, and so was his
superior. But in matters of local discipline, and in matters of doctrine,
the question of the relative authority‘of Pope and Council was more
debatable. As every one knows‚ the Council of Constance condemned

’ the doctrines of Wildif and of the Hussite reformers. ‘But the Pope

misleads and is misled‚' says Gascoigne‘(p. 152), ‘and his grants are not
to be interpreted by the grammatical meaning of the words which they
· contain’ Over and over again our author insists that his indulgences
