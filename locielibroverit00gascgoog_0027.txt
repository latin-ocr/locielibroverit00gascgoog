Oxford not later than 1416, when he was thirteen years of age. So
Ι early an age was in accordance with academical custom in the fifteenth
century, and indeed for long after. It is probable that he prosecuted
his studies as a commonet of Oriel College. He resided in that College
in later life, in a set of rooms which he hired of the Society3 for in
the register of the College, under the date Feb. 8, 1449, we read that in
consideration of a gift of money towards building, and books towards
fumishing their library‚ the Provost and Scholars of Oriel College
grant Dr. Gascoigne the use of his rooms rent free for the time of
his natural life, but without the power of subletting them. The extent
of Gascoigne's private resources excluded him from the benefit of a fel·
lowship. It was at Oriel that Gascoigne became acquainted with Praty,
bishop of Chichester, whom he mentions with praise, with Ly Hert, or
Ι Lye Hart, Provost of Oriel in 1443-5‚ and afterwards Bishop of
Norwich‚ whom he condemns, and Pecolr, Fellow of Oriel, and succes·
sively Bishop of St. Asaph and Chichester, whom he cordially detests.
Gascoigne was ordained priest by Bishop Fleming in 1417 (p. 179)
in the prebendal church of Tharne. His earliest, and for a long time
his only preferment was the rectory of Dighton (p. 175), a parish
which I cannot identify‚ beyond the fact stated by Gascoigne, that it
was in the diocese of York. In 1432 he was offered the chancellorship
of York Cathedral (pp. 51, 194), on the death of John Kexby, by
Kemp, then Archbishop, but declined it on the ground that the in-
come of the office was derived from the impropriation of two benefices,
and therefore was enriched at the expense of the parishioners and
parochial clergy of those two livings. In 1445, again, he was offered
the rectory of S. Peter’s, Comhill, (on the election of four doctors in
theology, and the nomination of the Lord Mayor‚ Aldermen‚ and
citizens of London,) at that time probably one of the most valuable
¹ pieces of preferment in the kingdom. He accepted the presentation
(p. 232) 3 but within the year, on St. Matthias’ day (Feb. 24), he resigned it
absolutely, feeling that his health was too infirm for the duties of the
office, and being firmly resolved, as he tells us, to undertake the re-
sponsibility of no church whose services he was not able to satisfy ,
personally. In 1448 he was made prebend of Combe Decima, in the
Cathedral of Wells, by Beckyngton‚ bishop of that see, and previously
