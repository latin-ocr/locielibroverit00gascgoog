mayor or bailiffs of the cities and towns, to put into execution the

decrees of the bishop's court. Universal suffrage was granted in
the enunties, and the language os the Commons was bold and even
minatory. No English sovereign, perhaps, whose life ended naturally,
had a more troubled and unhappy reign. He was born in the same
year as the cousin whom he deposed, and died before he reached
the 47th os his age. The attitude taken towards him, in what Gas-
coigne calls the letters patent os Northumberland‚ Edmund Mortimen
and Bardolf, is that os charging him with perjuries, calling on him to
resign his kingdom to the right line, claiming that the lords of the
kingdom should be judged by their peers, that the king’s council
should be reformed, that the sheriffs should be freely elected, and that
the privileges of Parliament should be respected. These articles, copied
by Gascoigne in his earlier hand, are interpolated in his latest, and
it seems clear that, in the minds ol many persons, the succession ol
the sixth Henry was tainted by the usurpatione ol the lourth. There
is not indeed the least hint in the ‘Liber Veritatum' that the claims
os Richard of York were conceived to be superior to those of the
reigning monarch‚ or that the missortunes of Henry's reign should
be a pretext for his deposition, still less that the young prince, Edward
os Lancaster‚ as the partisans of the rival house at last affirmed, was
supposititious, or even worse.

The defects in Henry's title, the perjuries or the harshness hy
which he had gained and kept his crown, the mean concessions by
which he had disarmed or conciliated opposition, were forgotten in
the splendid career os his son. Henry of Monmouth was twelve years
old at the time of Richard’s deposition, and sixteen when he fought
at Shrewsbury against the Percies. Perhaps the stories os his wild
youth are exaggerations, suggested by the stern morality os his riper
years. Never has an English king been more thoroughly popular than
Henry the Fisth. A conspiracy against him in the beginning os his
reign was put down without difficulty, and with little scandal. Itis
stated that Henry was induced to undertake the conquest os France,
or at least the recovery of Normandy and Guienne, at the instance
ol Chichele‚ the newly·appointed Archbishop os Canterbury, in order
to ward off a threatened attack on the temporalities ol the regular
