in accordance with the law os God, Ι do not find that Gascoigne recog· .
nises any control over the Pope in matters of saith and doctrine. Still
his opinions on indulgenceS, and his statement that the Pope is liable to
err in matters of fact, is a large qualification.

But, whatever may be his reverence for the Pope’s authority, and
however large he considers the Pope‘s powers of govemment, especially
over the monastic orders, he has no respect whatever ior the Pope’s court
and cardinals. ‘The Pope’ he says (p. 129), ‘is frequently constrained
by the excessive importunityof kingS, lords, and officers, of cardinals and
referendaries to grant much which he does not judge either by Holy
Scripture or common reason ought to be granted, and what is not in
harmony with the divine j udgment.' He gives a very dark picture of their
conduct (p. 148) towards their master and the church. ‘Romanis innata

Colonna rebelled against Eugenius IV, and tried to kill him, and how
the brother oi this Cardinal had been enriched by his uncle with the

of the archdeaconry of Canterbury, which he held in commendam, and
how Archbishop Chichele seized the opportunity to put his nephew
Thomas Chichele into the vacant benefice. At last Eugenius yielded to
the importunity os the Romans and his dread os them, and restored
Prosper. But the archdeaconry of Canterbury was gone, and Prosper -
sued Thomas Chichele in the Roman curia, where it was finally agreed
that Prosper should have two English rectories in commendam worth
a hundred pounds, and yet this Prosper always went up to the English
who might be in the Roman court, saying, ‘You English, give me back
my benefice.9 ‘This cardinal was appointed’ says Gascoigne, ‘by his
uncle when he was only eighteen years old. Ι have heard,’ he says
(p. 196), ‘that lately, in the time oi a pope who died a lew years ago-he
probably means Eugenius-the Pope, worn out by the importunities and
