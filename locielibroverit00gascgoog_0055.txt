were preachers in Gascoigne’s days our author informs ua who denounced
the vices of the time. These were chiefly the London clergy‚ three of
whom, the Rectors ol St. Andrew's, Holborn‚ and All Saints', and the
Master of Whittington College, spoke out boldly. But James Say, Lord
Fiennes, took care that the King should not hear what they said, ‘for he
and others about the King would allow no one to preach before the
King unless the sermon were written and subnritted to them, or unless
the preacher promised on oath that he would not preach against the
King's household‚ or against the King's doings, or against the doings ol

and 1447, and was one os the knights lor Northamptonshire.

The air of Westminster was pestilential, and the first session of the
new Parliament was held at the house of the preaching sriars near
Ludgate. The House debated public affairs, but there are few records os
their doings on the Rolls between the day ol their meeting and Dec. 17,
when they were prorogued. But it must have been to this time that the
following passage of Gascoigne refers. ‘The Parliament ol England
(p. 190), continually worried by annoyances and expenses, openly said
that it would never grant the king a tax unless he first by the authority
ol Parliament resumed all that really belonged to the Crown of England,
