DECOLLATIO RICARDI SCROPE‚ ARCH. EBORUM.

Nom

[let early life, Gascoigne seems to have written an account of the execution
of Scrope, archbishop of York, who had been compromised in the rebellion οἱ
the Percies. Gascoigne was anative of Hunslet‚ now a part of the ¹town os
Leeds, and lor many reasons must have been familiar with the details of an
event which was as shocking as it was novel; for it was unprecedented, and,
in the opinion oi the time, was sacrilegious. The MS, which appears to be in
Gascoigne’s handwriting, is to be found, with certain other documents, in MSS.
Bodley, Auctar iv. 5. The account given by Gascoigne was closely followed by
Clement ol Maidstone, though there are some variations in the narratives oi the
two. Τὴο first page of Gascoigne's MS. has long been lost, for the pagination
ol the book, which is continuous, is at least as old as the early part ol the seven·
teenth century. The portion between brackets is taken from ¹Clement oi Maid-
stone, and is probably almost identical with what was contained in the first page
of Gascoigne’s work. The volume, which belonged to Gascoigne, contains two
other entries in his later hand Another passage is taken from MS. os S. Augus-
tine's Civitas Dei (Bodley MSS. 198, which belonged to Grostete, and, as we are
informed in a note, was annotated by that prelate), and contains an account ol the
offer made to Gascoigne of the rectory ol S. Peter’s, Comhill, which was then,
as now, in the patronage of the Corporation of London.]
