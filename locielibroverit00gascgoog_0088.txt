in Cambridge, depended mainly for their revenues on tithes now entirely
secularised.

Every one has read of the ingenuity with which the monks sought
to evade the various statutes of mortmain. lt is said that English law
owes many of its technicalities and fictions to the devices of the monks,
who were always inventive and always baffled. lt is clear from Gas-
coigne that they had very much their own way with impropriations. lf
a landowner wished to improve his estate by an addition, the readiest
way was to exchange with the monastery for the great tithes of a benefice
which was in his patronage. If a benefactor wished to found a collegiate
choreb, or endow a cathedral with a number of new prebends, the great
tithes of parishes were the most obvious source, one which got him the
prayers of those whom he had endowed, at little or no expense to himself.
If the building funds of a cathedral fell short, if the offerings of the faith-
ful, and collections like those made for York (p. 1) were insufficient, the
tithes of a rectory could be made into a fund. If men believed still in
the superior efficacy of monastic prayers, the monks would rather accept
tithes th'an land. The settlement of the former was easy, that of the
latter perilous, for the heir of the grantor‚ or failing him, the crown, was
too much interested under the mortmain laws to allow their rights in
land to be set aside on account of the grahtor's soul.

To judge from the frequent and bittcr complaints of Gascoigne‚ this
impropriation must have gone on very extensively in his days. He quotes
many cases and dwells indignantly on the practice. A secular priest
himself, he believed sincerely in the parochial system, and in the benefit
bestowed on a parish by the residence of a conscientious, opulent, hos·
pitable, and benevolent rector. Under the significant heading of ‘F urtum’
(pp. 106-115), he writes at length on the evil which he saw done by im·
propriations. ‘ Ι knew,’ he says (prta), ‘a rector, who, from the income of
a single church which he held, maintained at school and the University
twenty youths whom he educated for the priesthood. You tell me,’ he
observes (purg), ‘that these impropriators pray for the parishioners of
these impoverished churches, and this, they say, does more good to them
than the prayers of one rector. But pray loolr at the reason of things. It
is better for me that you do good to me, than do good on my belralf ; just
as it is better for me, if l be hungry, that you give me food, than that you
