bail; and it is sor these reasons that they are glad that the law is trans-
gressed. Now, they say, our gains grow, when men break the law, and
they rejoice in the worst acts for the villainous gain which comes to them
lrom the offences os others. I heard a bachelor of law say “I wish there
were more criminals than there are, sor then we lawyers should do well‚”
that is, he wished men to be evil-doers, that he might get his profit lrorn
trials.’ Thereupon Gascoigne tells a story osone Richworth, a bailiff os
Henry V, who bribed a man to create a disturbance in order that he
might make a good thing ol it, and had his head broken, in satisfac-
tion os the bargain, by the man whom he had bribed.

In connection with this growth os litigation and chicanery‚ Gascoigne
states that latterly in England‚ about 1443, what he calls a falsa lex
was discovered, by which I suppose he means some precedent was estab-
lished in relation to entails. ‘Is any person has an estate in tail limited
to himself and the lawlul heirs ol his body, and mortgages this estate to
another ior a certain term, and the mortgage money be not paid on the
day appointed lor payment, the estate tail will pass to the mortgagee as
an estate in see simple, and the heir in remainder will be unjustly deprived
· ol his inheritance.' And then he says-the passage is rather obscure,—
‘Woe to him by whom the offence cometh, i.e. the origin ol such a
mischiel, that it may be possible to entail land, and that the lord ol a lee
simple, which he himsell has without condition, should give it on condition,
viz, that such and such persons should have the lands alter him.’

The reader will find much more than I have commented on in these
extracts. My object in writing this long introduction has been to give
some account ol the political and social condition of England in thetirst
hals os the fifteenth century, and particularly during the period which
followed alter the loss ol the English possessions in France to the time ol
Gascoigne's death. The greater part ol these notes were made Ι believe
in the last eight years ol Gascoigne’s lil . He lamented over the evils
which had already come upon England‚ and he foresaw that greater evils
were in store sor her. To the modern student not the least os these was
the wreck, sor nearly two centones, ol public liberty in parliamentary
institutions. Dark as the prospect was, unpromising as the materials were,
some statesmen in the middle oi the fifteenth century believed that they
could grapple with the difficulties of the situation. But their efforts were
