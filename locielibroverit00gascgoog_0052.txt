as the private or secular estate which they or others might enjoy (p. 100).
To Gascoigne, however, such tenets or rules 'of conduct were as odious
as any heresy, and in his opinion the principal causes ol corruption in
Church and State. ‘He claimed,’ says my author, ‘to be tried by his
peerS, by which he did not mean the English bishops, who were not at

that time, as some thought, lound to be competent, but he wanted to
have such examiners ol his books as he called his peers in scholastic
disputations‚ and in the popularity which he expected to get from his
young partisans, who were noted for unsound belief, and reputed to be
his followers’

Pecok was, it appears, an erastian, to use a phrase of later theology.
He held that a man ought to believe that there is a Catholic Church,
but need not abide by its decisione il he has sufficient ground for object·
ing in his own mind against them (pp. 100, 214). But his objections
were to be esotcric, not schismatic, and to be coupled with outward con·
formity. He would have the laity respect the motives and accept the
teachings ol the clergy, that it should not break away as the Lollards

and Bible men did, but he would exact no more than conformity. But
it is again difficult to doubt that he inclined to Arian tenets, il Gascoigne

(p. 217) is correct in ascribing the couplet to him, sor which he supplies
a rejoinder. ‘The law os England is that the lords of Parliament, when
accused of any great crime, should by twelve lords barons, their own
peers, be acquitted of the crime charged against them, or be pro·
nounced guilty ; but that Bishop Pacok’ (Gascoigne is plainly punning
on his name), ‘a Welshman by birth, accused these holy old doctors
of salsehood‚ or incompleteness in their writings, but he was proved to
be their equal‚ neither in holy lile, nor in their great learning and
miracles, and so, in rejecting them, he shot his arrow at the sun, and
his own arrow, by the just judgment of God, fell on the proper head
of that Bishop ol Chichester, Reginald Pacok’

Still it is not probable that the bishops ol Pecok’s day would have
proceeded to such lengths against their brother, who had excused them
their duties so handsomely, and in his book, ‘The Repressor of too much
blaming ol the Clergy,' had published a delence of the whole clerical
order, had he not committed some other fault. This I think must have

been the letter which Pecok sent in 1456 to Cannyng, the Lord Mayor
