subject of Henry. In those dayS, blood feuds were not early forgotten
and it is worth noting that Thomas Tresham, his eldest son, of whom
we shall hear presently, was Speaker of that Coventry Parliament in
'which the family of the Duke of York and all his adherents to the

number of twenty-four were attainted, and was himself attainted after

Towton, though restored by Edward IV. His grandson, RogerTresham‚
was also a Lancastrian, served in this interest at Empingham‚ was at·
,tainted in 1475, and restored by Henry Vll.

, The Speaker of the House which had lately separated, we can
, hardly say had been dissolved‚ during the hurry and alarm of Cade’s
insurrection‚ had appointed to meet the Duke of York‚ probably at his
castle of Fotheringay, who was now returned from Ireland, where he

acquainted with the plan of his journey. On Sept. 22, as Tresham and
his son Thomas were riding from their home at Sywell to the con-
