234 NOTES.

uon

¹²9· lt is from this passage that Ι have taken the title of the book.

130. Gascoigne is alluding to De la Bere, Bishop of St. David's.

141. The passage ‘ideo vocatur Wiclyffe nequam rita, memoriae ter dampnatae,’
fairly puzzled me, and all the antiquaries 10 whom l showed it. At last l
put the words before Mr. Thompson‚ of the MSS. department, British Museum‚
who suggested, after a few minutos, that the reading should be ‘nequam
vita‚’ and that the words were apuu on wikliffs name. The emendation
is one of those happy conjectures, which instantly approve themselves, and
are seen to he perfectly conclusive. lt may be observed that Knyghton
similarly jests on Wikliff’s name, saying that it would be more properly
‘Wicked belief!

168. For ‘Naturis apostolorum' read ‘Naturis apum.¹

175. Ι do not find Dighton as a parish at the present time.

193. The passage in spaced type is underlined and written in a larger hand in
the MS.

101. Gascoigne is referring to himself.

202. The sister referred to is probably that sister of the author who carried the
estate of Hunslet to a branch of the Westmoreland Neviles‚ through whom
it descended 1111, 11101 the rebellion of the N orthern Earls, it was forfeited.

lb. 'lbis is the source of the statement (copied by Hearne, and commented on by
many historians) as to the prodigious number of students at Oxford 111 the
fourteenth century.

¹ 204. l have no idea what the scribe intended by ‘Malkus’ The word is written
over ‘Cenomanniam.¹

218. The buming of Pecok’s books at Oxford (in the latter part 01 his account
Gascoigne generally calls him ‘Pac0k,' probably in contempt) on Dec. 17,
1457, is the latest fact noted in the Liber Veritatum.

229. Lingard doubts whether Scrope really approved of the remonstrance printed
here. ’1110 text however shows that he did, and that it is difficult to aequit
the archbishop of a design of deposing Henry.

232. The last passage will be found in faesimile at the title page.

Ψ 11 11 possible that ‘quum' has been printed for ‘quando' a few times. The
word is constantly written ‘qiu’ But 1 am infonned that this should always
be read as ‘quando’
