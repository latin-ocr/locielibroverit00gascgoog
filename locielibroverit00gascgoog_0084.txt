To go a little beyond the bounds of Gascoigne’s lile, no one who
studies the history ol the fifteenth century, especially that period
between 1449-1461, srom which so many important constitutional
principles can be, as they have been, derived, can fail os being struck
with the singular sacility with which the prelates of the age accom-
modated themselves to the times, without exception. Mr. Anything‚
or Mr. Facing·both-ways, in Bunyan’s allegory, were prentices to them.
Every English revolution, except that os the Royal Succession, has had
its episcopal partisans. Most of the English hierarchy were sacrificed
at the Conquest. William the Second, Henry, Stephen, had their
friends and soes on the episcopal bench. Henry the Second was in the
same position. John had to sace a true patriot in Stephen Langton‚
whom the Pope put on him, a man whose career and conduct must have
surprised the Pope as much as it daunted John. Henry the Third had
his allies among the prelates, and so had Simon de Montsort. Edward
had a struggle with them and quelled them. His miserable, soolish,
disreputable son had a foe in Orleton and a sriend in Stapledon. Merks,
if wc can trust the story, strove to maintain the rights os Richard the
Second, even when his cause was quite hopeless, as Arundel aided Henry.
But uo man among the bishops os Henry’s time, even those who owed
everything to him—men like Lyhart and Wainfleet, Chedworth‚ Car·
penter, Booth, Low—appears to have helped him by word or deed.
Bourchier had been made archbishop during Henry's insanity; Nevil
during the'first captivity of Henry, i. e. aster St. Alban’s But Bourchier
served every change with uniform pliancy. He crowned Edward the
Fourth in 1461. He had no scruple in welcoming the restoration os
Heury in 147¹· He congratulated the conqueror ol Barnet and
Tewkesbury. He acknowledged the title of Edward the Filth‚ accepted
the usurper’s claims with alacrity‚ and wheedled Elizabeth Woodvile out
of her other boy, who was with her in sanctuary. The last public act of

his long and contemptible career-for he was primate sor thirty-three
years—was to crown the founder of the house os Tudor. Among the
odious prelates of the fifteenth century this selfish, sordid, heartless,

time-serving churchman is the least respectable. Gascoigne formed
