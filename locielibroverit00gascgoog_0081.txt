Arundel and his bishops, and agreed to by the Convocation of Can·
terbury, by which preaching without the license of the diocesan was
inhibited. The motive is stated in the preamble of the Act to be

· ‘that the heretics make unlawful conventicles and confederacies hold

and exercise schools‚ make and write books' The Act did not, I ima·

gine, trench on the privileges ol either University, sor the grant of
a degree in Divinity has from time immemorial licensed the recipient
to lecture on the Epistles in the case ol a bachelor, and on the whole
oi Scripture in the case oi a Doctor, and till recently, did not require
priest's ordination for the inferior degree in Divinity.

Gascoigne tells us that Arundel (who had been banished by Richard
for participation in the rcsorms projected by the lords appellants‚ and
was doubtlessly much more oi a politieian than ol a divine), was only
a bachelor ol arts in Oxlord, that is‘, had merely obtained the slightest
rudiments ol an academical education. He had studied at Oriel, and
Gascoigne would have heard about him as a member os the same
college. He was not likely to know or discover· what would be the
consequence os his enaetment. The lieretical preachers were not si-

, William White‚ was very busy in disseminating the gospeller’s creed.
He had been a priest, had cast away his orders, had married a wife, and
went about the country on his mission‚ chiefly in eastern England. For
a long time he escaped, and seemed to bear a charmed lise, lor probably
the Norlolk weavers sympathised with him, harboured and hid him. At
last he was caught in Norwich, tried by the bishop, condemned, handed
over to the secular arm, under the statute de heretico comburendo, and
burnt in the courtyard before the cathedral close. When Ι happened
to be at Norwich, just aster the recess of 1880, I inspected the Corpora-
tion accounts, and found under the year 1427 what it eost the Corporation
to burn William White‚ and two other heretics‚ William Whaddon and
Hugh Pye. They were not the only victims ol the year.

The grant of the license to preach was abused. The bishops
issued very lew licenses‚ exacted large sums of money lor their letters
and their seals, and made the license revocable at pleasure. ‘The
bishops do not preach, and will not suffer others to do sp, except at
the entreaty of great lords. lt may bc proper that the unworthy should
