Their acts were criticised by the preachers and the public (p. 44).
Dr. William Millington, of Clare Hall‚ Cambridge, a lforlrshire man with
whom Gascoigne has many sympathies, spoke openly in his sermon at
Paul’s Cross, immediately after Pecok's famous apology for the non-
preaching prelates. ‘On pain of my head, Ι pledge myself that this realm
of England will never prosper until they who approve the sentiments of
Bishop Reginald are soundly chastised.' This was the opinion of many. ·

Laymen and nobles said of that Bishop Pecok, ‘Heigh-hol we are bound
by the Lord’s command to teach our families, and that bishop says that
bishops are not bound to teach their dioceses’ They were rarely pre·
sent there. Stafford, De Moleyns, Lyhart, Lumley, Aiscough, and Booth
held offices at court, four of them secular functions, all requiring con-
stant absence from their people. Kemp, t00, the Archbishop of Yorlr,
was constantly at court or at his country house in Kent.

A custom began, says Gascoigne (pp. 132,168), in the days of
Martin V (evil times in Gascoigne's mind) and of Eugenius IV, of getting
licenses for non-residencc on behalf of their chaplains up to a certain
number. One bishop nominated as his chaplain one who was both rector
and vicar. But on his admission to this office, he neither resided in
the bishop’s house, nor at his own cure, but gave himself up for years
to hunting and carnal delights, saying that he had the license of the
Pope for these practices Many others, in the same manner, betook them·
selves to hawking and hunting. Others, without gettinga license to hold
pluralitieS, get benefices for others, and before they present, make the
presentee sign a legal bond to the effect that he will pay twenty marks
or more yearly to the patron or the agent. This practice, says Gascoigne,
was detected by Philip Morgan‚ Bishop of Ely (21426-143 5), who com·
pelled all whom he admitted to benefices to take oath that they had
not entered and would not enter into such bondS, and that they had not
given security that they would not sue the monlrs to whom a vicarage
had been appropriated for the full value of the benefice.

Against these ignorant, corrupt, and shameless traffrclrers in the
endowments of the church, it was reasonable that the law should accord
to lay patrous the protection of those writs, which have been issued siuce
the Constitutions of Clarendon. ‘Alas,’ says Gascoigne (p. 33), ‘how
unluclry are the times in which we live, when the prelates give themselves
