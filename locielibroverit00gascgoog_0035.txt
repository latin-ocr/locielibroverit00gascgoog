Henry the Fiith‚ was a saint. He was not a monh, as some have
said, for the English monk of the fifteenth century was, as a rule, a
gross and greedy voluptuary, whom no one respected, but no one yet
‚saw how to get decently rid ol, except piecemeal, as sor example when

, Waynflete was founding his college at Oxford, and Alcock his at Cam·

bridge. Nor did Henry affect asceticism, or pretend to dispense with
natural affections. He loved his mother, he was warm-hearted to all his
kinssolk‚ he loaded the man who was afterwards his rival with benefits,
he heaped savours on the Neviles, who owed everything to his dynasty,
and on the Mowbrays, who had been the hereditary ioes of his family, as
well as on the Beaulorts, the PercieS, and the Poles, who were his para-
sites and his ruin. He was gentle and affectionate to the imperious
woman whose fortunes were tied to his own, whose mad fury destroyed
his dynasty by putting an end for ever at Coventry to all hopes oi
reconciliation between the sactions, whose northern army, by its
devastations, set all Eastern England and London against the house

wick‚ who seems to have scourged all spirit out of him in his youth.
Henry was the only English saint of the fifteenth century.

As a king, Henry was the most unlucky oi English monarchs.
He inherited a war, in which indeed he took no part, except as part of a
pageant. The war which made others rich made him a pauper. Sir
John Fastolse and Lord Cromwell collected gigantic fortunes lrom their
spoils and from lucrative trade. The opulence oi the houses oi Nevile,
Beausort, Holland, Pole, Stafsord, and the rest, was prodigious. The
riches oi the English nobles were a matter of wonder even to those who
had been familiar with the wealth oi the house of Burgundy‚ and ol the
Flemish burghers. But the English King, on whom and on whose
revenue the cost oi all the administration was imposed‚ was far poorer
than most of the nobles who supported his throne, and had good reason
sor supporting it, but were quarrelling over the succession3 while an
infinite nrob (we can read them in the exceptions to the acts of resump-
tion) was squabbling over the plunder ol the Crown, which was really the
plunder of the nation. (Rot. Parl. iv.)

Matters came to a crisis in 1450. The debts ol the Crown, mainly
sor the maintenance oi the King's household‚ amounted to {372,000,
