Harrowdem in a petition presented to the Westminster Parliament of
November, in which she gives a long and circumstantial narrative of the
manner in which her husband had been trepanned and murdered. She
claims the right of appeal to men of Northamptonshire only, on behalf
of herself, or, in the event of her death, for her son. Tresham dwelt in
his own country, and his widow knew that she could obtain justice from
the verdict of her neighbours lhave little doubt that the blow which
fell on Tresham was intended for Parliament, and that whosoever set
the assassins on, hoped that the fate of the Speaker would counsel
prudence to all constitutional reformers for the future.

If the murderers of Tresham intended to cow the Parliament, they
were for the time disappointed. The House which met on Nov. 9,1450,
went to work on the lines of its predecessor. It elected as its Speaker

It then presented an extraordinary petition to the King, requiring
him to ordain, by authority of Parliament, that certain persons, thirty in
number, should be banished from the court, at a distance of not less
than twclve miles from the king’s residence, under pain of forfeiting
lands and goods. The most important persons in this list are the Duke
