eminent doctors of the age, were traduced before the King and Council‚
when the real causes were the wrongs of the kingdom, the enormous
taxes, the total lailure of justice both in civil and ecclesiastical murts, so
that il the preachers had been silent, the stones, i.e. the people, would
have cried out!

Hitherto‚ all action which had been taken by the Commoris or by
the insurgents‚ by Parliament which fairly expressed the national senti-
ment, and by associations which professed to do so irregularly, had been ,
on the side os the reforming party. Suffolk had been expelled srom the
royal councils, and dispatched by an agency only less informal than that

stable grooms It would have been infinitely better sor Henry's house-
the malcontents would never have touched him—if he had let Suffotk

ol the English Parliament. The two houses were obviously at one, and
it was plain that ii the two worked together they could strike terror into
bad ministers. Sir John Popham, who had been first elected, declined
the office on the ground ol age and infirmity, but more probably srom
timidity, and Tresham had consented to serve again. I do not conclude
that he was revolutionary, still less Yorkist in his tendencies. 1 see no
reason to believe that in the sense of hostility to Henry and Henry’s
family, there was a Yorlrist party. It is probable that he was a loyal
