by their curt answer to the Chancellor on March 13, when he informed
thern that k4o,000 was urgently and instantly wanted sor the defence of
Calais and the marches which were in jeopardy. They flatly refused to¹
make any more grants, reminding Kemp of an unsulfrlled promise to
them, that public affairs should be directed by a ‘sad and wise council ol
right discreet and wise lords and others! The Commons elected a new
Speaker‚ Sir Thos. Cherleton, and Thorpe remained in prison. No further
information is given as to the fate of Raleigh. Thorpe must have been
released soon afterwards. He was present next year at the affair oi St.
Alban's, and does not appear to have been distinguished by personal
courage on that occasion.

The malady os the King continued. He had been moved to Windsor,
and some means had been taken sor the conductos ordinary business by
the appointment of the Duke of York to the iunction of presiding over

the Parliament‚ now most unwontedly in the second year oi its sitting.
But a crisis soon occurred. On March 22, Kemp, Archbishop os Canter-
bury and Lord Chancellor‚ died suddenly. He had been nominated to
the archbishopric‚ Gascoigne tells us (p. 37), by Somerset, and had been

successively Bishop os Rochester, Chichester, London, York, and lastly

was Archbishop of York, he was wholly absent lrom his diocese, residing
in London, or in Kent, or in other parts os England lar away lrom his
diocese, except that once in ten or a dozen years he stayed there for two
or three weeks. He was seldom or never in York, and suffered his palace
to fall into decay, ior he never repaired it during the time he filled the see?

My readers will remember the manner in which Macaulay dilates on
the ssight of James from Whitchall, and the disappearance oi the Great
Seal, which the King threw into the Thames. ln the fifteenth century, the
continuous use os the Great Seal, always in the custody of the Chancellor‚
was even more important. It was absolutely necessary sor the conduct ol'
business to fill the vacant office, and none but the King could appointthe·
Chancellor‚ Hitherto it appears that he had been in the Queen's keeping,
and that no one had seen him since his malady had commenced, except
the members of his household. It was determined at once to appoint a
