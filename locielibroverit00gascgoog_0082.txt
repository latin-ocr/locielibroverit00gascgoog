be excluded from the office, ol the preacher, but why should all be
suspended, and be exposed to the extortions or the caprices ol the
diocesan? Man should not impose silence on all doctors and bishops
because several ol both kinds are heretica. But,' adds my author,
‘the judgment ol God carne on the archbishop. His throat was choked
so that he could neither swallow nor cough; and thus he, who by his
own tongue had stopped the word ol God, had his tongue stopped
when he was anxious above all things to speak‚ The silencing ol the
⁵ preachers was a matter to murmur at, having been done in order to
suspend a lew hereticS, but the bishops did not or could not preach
themselves, and were angry (p. 35) when men said “Such and such
a doctor preaches well, though no bishop, but our bishop neither can
nor will preach‚ and so one who is no bishop does more good than

The corruption and pride ol the fifteenth-century bishops is illus· Α

everywhere, but is put in the most flagrant view in p. 123, where an
archbishop (undoubtedly Ken1p‚ oi York,) bids the curates ol his diocese

The two stories are so characteristic that Ι am tenrpted to translate
them. ‘Henry IV, King of England, asked Henry Bowet‚ Archbishop

said, “Is you will, sir, that l should speak‚ l will mention what seem to me
to be the four causes of the lact.” The king gladly gave him leave.
“One cause‚'' said the clerk, “ was, that once God showed by some special
sign who was worthier than other men by reason os his wisdom and
holy lise to be made bishop, and thereupon God made miracles on behall
oi persons thus elected in their lile and alter their death. But now such
persons are chosen by earthly persons and by you kings to be bishops as
pleases you, and just the same miracles which you kings do, the bishops

holy and learned men to undertake episcopal duties, because these duties
