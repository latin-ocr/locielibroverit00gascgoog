nor granted, nor could grant acceptably in the sight of God, and so,' said
the bishop, ‘l will not act according to your bull‚ sor Ι believe that the
Pope never gave it in words, and l know that he cannot grant it in fact,
sor the power given him by Christ is that he should bind what man may
rightly bind, and bind and loose without man's consent any human act,
but only as it accords with the increase ol God’s worship and the true
sasety of souls. No man os sane mind could accept your contention‚
that any one who has a papal license to the effect, shall be absolved
by any competent priest.’

But the most striking illustration ol the bishop in Gascoigne’s age is
to be found in a story which he tells of De la Bere, Bishop ol St. David's
(p. 35). This man had been Henry’s almoner, had been made Dean of
Wells by papal provision (p. 200), and had caused infinite scandal by the
appointment. To put an end to the scandal, the same agency of a
papal provision was brought into operation, and De la Bere was made

them, and these concubines may never have an opportunity of sinning
by cohabiting with us.'’ And that bishop os detestable memory’ (he
outlived Gaseoigne) ‘answered them, “I will not grant that your con·
cubines be separated srom you or your homes, orbe compelled to leave
them, lor in that case, l your bishop should yearly lose 400 marks,
which Ι receive yearly in my diocese sor the priests’ concubines, lor

Ι get yearly a noble or more srom each of many priests for his con·
cubine, and the sum which comesto my purse makes annually 400

said to that Bishop of Saint David's in Wales, ‘⁶ Ο lord bishop, we wish
