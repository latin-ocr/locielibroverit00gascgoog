Lancaster, during the time of the King’s insanity. Between the death
of Gloucester and the birth of Edward‚ the possible rivals sor the throne,
should it become vacant, were the niece os the Duke of Somerset, whose
family, it appears, had been legitimated without reservation, the nearest
representative ol the house of Lancaster, and. the Duke of York, who
had assuredly never lorgotten his superior claim to the throne, and was
looked on by all parties as first prince of the blood.

The episode of Joan ol Arc was vexatious, and led to the raising
ol the siege os Orleans, and the occupation of Rheims. But the English
held possession os Paris till April, 1436, and of Normandy and Guienne
lor a much longer period. But in lact, no army ol English, however
numerous and however well appointed, could have kept France in sub·
jection. It would have been necessary to garrison every town with
English troops, at least in other than the hereditary dominions of the
Plantagenet kings, and to have secured the constant services ol a strong
ally on the mainland. For a time the English had such an ally in
the Duke os Burgundy. But when the alliance was broken by the raid
on Calais, and the death ol Bedsord, the hope os occupying France was
gone, and the utmost which the exertions ol the English could expect
was the retention ol Normandy and Guienne, the connecting link of
which was Anjou and Maine.

The possession of Normandy was, according to the policy of Eng-
land in the fifteenth century, and indeed for a long time afterwards,
os signal importance. It enabled the English navy to keep the mastery
of the narrow seas, and the control over those seas was equivalent to
the control of all commerce by sea. This is shown with great clear-
ness and detail in that remarkable political tract, published in the
Rolls' Series, among other political songs and ballads of the fourteenth
and fifteenth centuries, by the late Mr. Wright, under the title of
‘A Libel os English Policy.’ The whole mercantile marine of Europe
was engaged in coasting along France to the Low Countries‚ with the
exception of that—already almost lost, owing to the decline of the Greek
empne-which passed up the Danube, and that which was carried on the
highway ol the Rhine. The occupation of two strongly lortified ports
at the narrowest part of the Channel, at Dover and Calais, was the key
of the position, and the repulse ol the Flemings from before Calais, in
