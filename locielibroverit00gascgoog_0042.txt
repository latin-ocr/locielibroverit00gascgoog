ordinary tax on rents, annuities, and salarieS, including the estates
held in ancient demesne, and ordinarily exempted from parliamentary
taxation. This income-tax was graduated. Incomes under sorty shil·
lings a-year were exempt3 on those between lorty shillings and twenty
pounds, the tax was sixpence in the pound3 on those between Ano and
hzoo, it was a shilling3 on those above 16200 a-year, two shillings
The tax was ‘thought reasonable’ by the Lords and assented to by
the King. But I shall have to refer to the Parliarnent os 1449-50

Thorpe did not follow this precedent in 1453, bold and just as
it was, but proposed the familiar fifteenth and tenth, which had now
become sor a long time a fixed quantity. The grant is to be dimi·
nished by 166,000, in consideration ol certain towns which had become
