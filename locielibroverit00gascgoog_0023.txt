The special value of these extracts from Gascoigne’s Manu·
script resides in the fact, that they are singularly illustrative of
the darkest period in the social and political history of England.
Other contemporary materials are, first, the Rolls os Parliament‚
which have never been sufficiently examined; next, the dry
Chronicle os Wyrcestre; next, the pedantic dissertations ol
Whetehamstede; and lastly, the Paston Letters. For the rest,
the student os history must rely on the narratives os the
Tudor annalists. ln Gascoigne we have an estimate of English
society, made by a contemporary who had considerable opp
portunities for forming a judgment, and possessed sufficient
fearlessness in dealing with men and facts. His words may
sometimes seem to be those os a disappointed man, osten of
an angry man; but os his genuine piety, and sincere desire for
the reformation of society, there can be no doubt.

Other manuscripts ol Gascoigne, and probably the original
os these volumes, were in the Cotton Library (Otho), and
perished when the house in Little Dean’s Yard, where the
library was placed, was consumed.
