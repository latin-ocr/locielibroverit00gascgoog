schedule ol which is annexed to the petition, and as, had a trial taken
place, he would assuredly have been convictcd and attainted‚ an Act ol
Parliament should be passed in proper sorm to declare William de la
Pole a trahor, that his blood should be pronounced corrupt, his heirs
incapable os inheritance from him, and his whole estate be forfeited to
the crown, except such as he might hold in trust lor others The petition
prays that the same lorleiture should extend to his chattels save moneys
paid by a certain date, and gifts made by the Duke to the University os
Oxford. The petition concludes by charging Pole, in addition to his other
misdeeds, with having contrived and effected the arrest, imprisonment,
and final destruction ol the Duke os Gloucester, with having abridged the

House is a genuine reflexos public opinion; and they who can read
between the lines ol the Rolls os Parliament can without any violent
effort recall the motives, the speech, and the acts os those who vainly
but honestly endeavoured to arrest the progress os those impulses
which were hurrying the nation into civil war. Unsortunately lor the
statesman ol the filteenth century, there was no remedy to be found
against the two cankers ol the time, the total corruption ol the church,
and the utter lawlessness os the aristocracy. To pull down one bad
man, like Suffolk, was merely to make room for another bad man, like
Somcrset. To ruin and degrade a mischievous and conceited prelate
like Pecok‚ was to make a place for an equally mischievous, rnore im-
moral, and intinitely ruore ignorant person, like Nevil. Pecok indeed
