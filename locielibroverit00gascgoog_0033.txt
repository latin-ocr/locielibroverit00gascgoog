xxiv IN TRODUC TI ON.

August, 143 5, was great cause ol pride in English prowesS, though it lore·
shadowed Burgundy's desertion. But the occupation of Normandy was
hardly of less importance. Il Normandy were in the hands of England,
she could prevent piracy or privateering in the numerous ports ol that
duchy‚ and could keep in check the corsairs of Brittany, who were sor
many a year after that time the pests of the coasting trade. Long alter
the discovery ol the New World‚ and that of the Cape passage, had made
the ancient routes of commerce less important, the retention ol Calais
was supposed to be the key to England’s maritime power, and a bridle
on the Netherlands and on Franee. A century alter Calais was lost,
Cromwell consulted that old instinct ol England which desired a lortified
port on the French and Flemish frontier, by the seizure and fortification
os Dunkirk, the sale of which to Louis the Fourteenth was conceived to
bea political crime and a political blunder ol the gravest kind.

The mastery over the narrow seas was not only a political security‚
but in the opinion of the age, a mercantile necessity. The principal
articles ol English exportation at the time were wool and hides. The
wool trade was the chief source of English wealth, and almost the only
means by which England could acquire possession ol foreign products.
'It may seem strange to us now, but England was almost the only
European country from which this absolute necessary ol lile, second only
to food, could be procured. A small quantity, and that, as we are told, ol
aquality which was unworkable except alter mixing with English pro-
duce, was obtained by a tedious sea voyage from Spain. England in
the filteenth century had the monopoly of the wool market to a greater
extent than even the United States had ol cotton belore the outbreak
ol the war between the slave-owners and the Commonwealth ol the
States. The free export of wool lrom England meant that the looms
ol Bruges, Ghent, and Antwerp, and a hundred other thriving Flemish
towns, should go on merrily, that employment should be abundant, that
profit's should accumulate, that wealth should be diffused. Restraints
upon this article meant the decay of industry, discontent, and serious
outbreaks The basis os those negotiations with the Low Countries,
which began with Philip Van Arteveldt‚ and were best illustrated‚ in the

days os Henry the Seventh, by the success os the Intercursus Magnus,
was English wool, its free or restrained export.
