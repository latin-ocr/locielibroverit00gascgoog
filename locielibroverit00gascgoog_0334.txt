NOTES.

Pacu

1. The F abric Rolls of York Minster, published by the Surtees society, fumish
abundant evidence of the activity with which the injunctions referred to in
the text were carried out on behalf of the fabric.

3. The Regents of the University of Oxford were the young Masters‚ those namely
under two years’ standing. Gascoigne constantly speaks of the power which
they possessed, and the abuses which characterised their practices.

9. There is some confusion in Gascoigne’s mind about the order of the Bohemian
succession‚ and the number of the B0hemian Kings of the name of Wen·
ceslaus.

11. Aiscough's name is very variously spelt in the Liber Veritatum.

16. Gascoigne seems to acquiesce later on in N evil’s appointment‚ in consequence
of the active part which the young bishop took against Pecok. At the
accession of Edward IV the Bishop of Exeter was made Constable of
Windsor Castle.

22. The archbishop in this story is probably Stafford. He was, according to the
genealogists, brother of the Duke of Buckingham. Gascoigne (p. 231) says
that he was illegitimate.

26. lt appears that the charges against Pecok in this passage were written before
he had committed what were, in Gascoigne's eyes, the far graver offences
mentioned at the conclusion of the work.

35. This story of De la Bere points manifestly to a married clergy in South Wales.

37. Richard Andrew, first Warden of All Souls, Oxford, was secretary for many
years to Henry Vl.

45. This passage illustrares the continuity of the practice of audit at the Exchequer,
which the Dialogus, first published by Madox, describes.

53. This article, which is given in full, appears to be a sermon of Gascoigne’s. If
so, it is the only document of this kind which, being found among his papers,
was transcribed entire into the Liber Veritatum.

88. The reference to St. Gregory is left blank

118,119. The blanks are omissions of quotations from the fathers.

12 5. Peter de Monte was made Bishop of Rrescia

127. At this place the extracts from the first volume are concluded, and those from
the second begin.
