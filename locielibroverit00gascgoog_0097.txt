priests whom they trained, and the court made them even more depraved.
1 However saintly might have been the lile ol the king, however ardent his

piety‚ however hateful in his eyes cruelty and licentiousness were, the
age was eminently licentious and cruel. The dress os men and women
was in the last degree indecent (the fashion [p. 144] began in 1429), and
all the vices which might be expected from such sashions followed.
The season ol Christmas was profaned by ribald songS, so shocking that,
says my author, ‘an eminent person that Ι knew os, on hearing one os
these indecent ditties, could not get it out of his head, nor lorget its
images, and became so oppressed by the recollection that he died? ‘The
