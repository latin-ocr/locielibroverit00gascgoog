entreating him to re-commit Somerset into the hands os two knights, who
should convey him to the Totver into lawful custody; that this petition
was refused, and that thereupon he attached Somerset, who was then in
St. Alban’s, preserring that Somerset should be taken prisoner, than that
he (the Duke of York) should be seized and slain by Somerset. No one
was spoiled of his goods with the Duke’s will, but against it, as I heard
from trustworthy persons, and the Duke of York‚ Richard, had his
pardon or indulgence granted him by Parliament in London, along with
his adherents in the battle of St. Alban’s, sor all that had been done in
that battle, and sor everything occurring there, on which any man might
make plea or quarrel against the Duke or against his comrades.’ Somerset,
who was killed at St. Alban's on May 22, 14 55, with the Earl of North-
umberland, and Lord clifford, had been released srom the Tower on
Feb. 5 preceding, by the King's writ.

The battle of St. Alban’s, though in itself a mere skirmish, developed
the inextinguishable feuds of the civil war. The quarrels os Lords Devon

bad blood enough. The Queen, aster the loss os three among her more
zealous partisans, made up her mind to the ruin ol =Y0rk, and the ad-
vantage which York gained at St. Alban’s made him equally determined
to secure himself from risk by obtaining a recognised position in the state,
under the authority os Parliament. The King did his best to mediate
between the parties, and effected srom time to time formal but hollow
reconciliations. But nothing could erase the bloodshed os St. Alban’s,
and as Gascoigne is lond of saying ‘sanguis sanguinem tetigit)

The Parliament ol 1455 met on July 11, and the Commons presented
Sir John Wenlok as their Speaker. They were soon prorogued to Nov.
12, for the harvest was at hand. On Nov. 19 York was again appointed
Protector, for the King’s mind was again affected, though not, it appears,
so seriously on this occasion. There is, indeed, a commission issued on
June 5, to Gilbert Keymer, Dean os Salisbury, and Doctor ol Medicine,
the King’s physician, and on March 10, 1456, another commission is
