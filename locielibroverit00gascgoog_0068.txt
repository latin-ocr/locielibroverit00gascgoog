was a man os learning, who might have held his own despite his sus·
picious theology‚ if he had not meddled with politics on his own
account. Nevil was a youth, who was not old enough to be con·

secrated, even by the most pliant of popes, to his see (p. 16), and yet
he felt himself able in Pecok’s humiliation to twit him (p. 213) with
his contempt for the holy doctors. Ι cannot but think that there is
not a little sarcasm in Pecok's reply: ‘I regret that Ι wrote so, for Ι
did not look sufficiently to the circumstances?

Again, the events ol these six years, compared with the earlier
days of the Long Parliament, and the earlier action ol the Convention
Parliament, not to go later down, are confirmatory oi the lact that
ior centuries the solution ol political difficulties has been manageable
by a well-ordered and patriotic Parliament. To mymind, the par-
liamentary leaders ol these six years ol the fifteenth century are as
real, as noble, and as worthy as any in the long succession os wise
statesmen that l have read of, or have known. To reconcile order
and freedom, to formulate and maintain all legitimare rights, to in-
terpret the prerogatives ol government by its duties, and to judge it
by its acts and its motives is and always will be, the fonction of
parliamentary control. And Ι venture on saying that there is no
single principle of government and finance, no serious issue between
the administration and the nation, which was not, if one reads the
facts aright, present in the constitution which Fortescue lauded, and
Tresham and his lellows guarded. The experience ol the fifteenth
century statesmen was narrow; he had to create his precedents, and
to define his procedure, but he was resolved on maintaining the in-
stitutions which he had inherited. Alter the vices of the two most
powersul lactors in the state, the Church and the nobility‚ made ruin
ol those labours which would have given England a genuine Parliament,
well lortified by neediul privileges, and yet strong in that modest sels· ⁶
respect which assists men more than anything else to wise speech and
counsel, aster despotism seemed the only refuge from anarchy, and
England went back two centurieS, the successors ol the fifteenth century
statesmen cherished their traditions‚ and in good time revived them for
opportune action. The arraignment ol Sufsolk by Tresham is as in·

teresting a study as the impeachment ol Strafford by Pym. There is
