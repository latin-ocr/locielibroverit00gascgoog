mischiel is, that founders and their successors should strictly enjoin‚
under heavy penalties‚ that is any of their foundationers takes any license
against the will and statutes of the founder, he shall be ipso sacto deprived
os all right to any benefit accruing to the foundationers, and it shall even ’
be ordained by the founder or by parliament, that the heir or successor

With such bishops and such monks‚ with dignities openly sold at
Rome and scandalously misapplied in England‚ it was not likely that
the parochial clergy would be of a very high order. The proceedings
commented on above had impoverished them, the lears and the jealousy
of the bishops had silenced them, and the Lollards derided these mass-

been constrained to omit some oi the particulars which my author's

pp. 53-99. This is probably a concio ad clerum, a discourse addressed to
the University, and is very instructive, not only as a specimen of an
elaborate fifteenth-century sermon, but as a statement os the condition ol
the Church at the time in which it was composed. The seven streams
are: 1. The unworthy and scandalous ordination and institution of
bishops, rectors, and officials, which is called promotion. 2. The absence
oi a good rector srom a people whom he should govern. 3. Pluralities
4 The appropriation or annexing of churches and tithes to those who

have not the immediate cure os the parishioners. 5. The abuse os

absolution by priests. 6. The abuse of indulgentes. 7. The abuse of
