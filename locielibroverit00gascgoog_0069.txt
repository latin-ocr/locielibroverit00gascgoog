lx INTRODUCTION.

only one figure in the scene to which English history afsords no parallel,
that of the blameless and helpless king.

Again‚ in order to read between the lines of these invaluable frag-
ments of Gascoigne's ‘Liber Veritatum,’ and to see how, with naturally
clerical leaningS, he was alive to the present difficulties and impending
sorrows of his own generation, one must know the concentration of English
social lile in the fifteenth century from its highest and widest mani-
festations in Parliament. The personality of Gascoigne is that os a well·
connected, fairly-opulent English priest, who was stored with the learning
of his age, was honoured by his contemporaries was orthodox in his
beliels, but unsparing in his condemnation oi those who did not reach
what he believed to be the standard of public and private duty. Had
he set his heart on wealth, he would have done better asan honest
tailor. He has friends: Robert ThwaiteS, master os Baliol, and
William Grey, ol the same College, afterwards Bishop of Ely, are

the exportation os the nation's wealth by the pardon·mongers who came
there ; God himself wrought a special miracle by John Capistran0, the
monk who led the Christian host to its unequal combat with Waldewach,
but the English prelateS, with Bourchier at their head (p. 48), the
successoros the slothful Kemp and the licentious Stafford, gave no
thanksgiving for the deliverance os Christendom, for the first arrest
of the great wave which seemed likely to again enguls the West in
a savage barbarism. Oxford, indeed, had the grace to give thanks,
to sing solemn chantS‚ to make a general processi0n‚ with a T e Deum
Laudamus, on St. Lucy's morrow (September πο), when an ancient
