professed monk could be elected to a bishopric, and the people‚ who
were thus entreated, accepted episcopal duties for the salvation os souls
reluctantly, and thereupon were translated alter death by reason of their
miracles. Again‚ holy bishops os old, reflecting on the episcopal duties
put on them, did not wish to be translated lrom bishopric to bishopric
ior the sake os larger revenueS‚ but now they are translated from bishopric
to bishopric in their lives and so do not deserve to be translated by the
evidence os miracles aster their death. Again‚ in these days, men buy
their translations and their bishoprics so dearly in their lives, that they
are not worth translating aster their deaths, nor that God should do

predecessor, who had been archbishop before him, was the son os
a common man (Chichele's father was said to have been a tailor). The
poor man answered the archbishop's servant, ‘⁴ The present archbishop
and his predecessor were certainly of very different breeding, but it is
clear for all that, that his predecessor was the better man, and more
