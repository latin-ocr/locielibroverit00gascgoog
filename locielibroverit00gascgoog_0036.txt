grievance. The necessary expenses of the household were A24ooo

for the payment os those who supplied provisions to the household, and
put the proceeds into the hands of the Steward, Treasurer, and Comp-
troller of the Household lor the time being. They added to this sum
all the revenues of the Duchy of Lancaster, saving the Queen's jointure,

which a modern Chancellor ol the Exchequer might well envy, all direct.
The Crown had 3 right of preemption of 311 products and all services,
